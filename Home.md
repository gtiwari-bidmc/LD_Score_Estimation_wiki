Welcome to the `ldsc` wiki. This is the main repository for LD Score documentation. If you're just starting to use LD Score, the tutorials on [[LD Scores|LD Score Estimation Tutorial]], [[heritability, genetic correlation and the LD Score regression intercept| Heritability and Genetic Correlation]] and [[partitioned h<sup>2</sup>|Partitioned Heritability]] describe how to run `ldsc`. The [[FAQ|FAQ]] answers several common questions about `ldsc` output. 

Note: Summary statistics from linear mixed models cannot be used to estimate SNP-heritability, but they can be used for estimating genetic correlation and partitioned heritability. This is because they have an "effective sample size" which differs from the true sample size; this affects SNP-heritability estimates but cancels out in the estimation of genetic correlation or proportion of heritability.
